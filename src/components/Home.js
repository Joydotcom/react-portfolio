        <p>
          As a 2008 graduate of Montclair State University with a Bachelors of
          Science in Kinesiology, I soon started my teaching journey, as a
          Performing Arts teacher and coordinator for the duration of 13 years! In
          the field of education, we are required to wear many hats. Educators
          must be flexible, juggle multiple concerns at once, and effectively
          communicate with other staff and parents (sometimes irate). In a setting
          where children are top priority, attention to detail is an
          understatement. We must be able to quickly assess any situation and rely
          on critical thinking to utilize the proper strategies and skills to
          solve the problem â€“ professionally and accurately. These skills I have,
          and continue to, successfully develop. It is my belief that these skills
          translate to my next career endeavor - The Tech Industry. As a graduate
          of the Full Stack Web Development BootCamp at Georgia Tech, I'm eager to
          gain experience and continue my learning through Software Engineer
          opportunities!
