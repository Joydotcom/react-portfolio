        As a recent graduate of Georgia Tech's, Full Stack Web Development
        bootcamp, I am eager to continue my professional experience in the Tech
        Industry. I have a B.S. in Kinesiology, a professional teaching
        certification in Performance Art and Design, and a certification in Full
        Stack Web Development.
        <br></br>I have been a professional educator for 12+ years, having
        experience as a Student Development Coordinator and Performance Art and
        Design Teacher. Through my Educational Leadership graduate studies, I
        was successful in the implementation and facilitation of student success
        programming and professional staff development.
        <br></br>I also had the pleasure of working in the services industry
        part time for many years as an Assistant Creator in Nightlife for the
        Atlantic City Casinos and Resorts. My role included assisting the
        Director with Nightlife Entertainment Procedures and Protocol,
        overseeing Services for Entertainment Guests, presenting data, and
        conducting rehearsals. In all of my roles I must be flexible, juggle
        multiple concerns at once, and effectively communicate with my team.
        Attention to detail is always a top priority. I must be able to quickly
        assess any situation and rely on critical thinking to utilize the proper
        strategies and skills for problem solving â€“ professionally and
        accurately.<br></br> I am certain that these skills translate well into
        the Tech Industry, and will be an asset to any position, team, and
        company.
