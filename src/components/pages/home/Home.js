        As a Software Engineer in Full Stack Web Development, I am eager to continue my professional experience in the Tech
        Industry. I hold a B.S. in Kinesiology, a professional teaching
        certification in Performance Art and Design, and a professional certification in Full
        Stack Web Development.
        <br></br>I have been a professional educator for 12+ years, having
        experience as a Student Development Coordinator and Performance Art and
        Design Teacher. Through my Educational Leadership graduate studies, I
        was successful in the implementation and facilitation of student success
        programming and professional staff development.
        <br></br>I also had the pleasure of working
        part time for as an Assistant Director in Nightlife for the
        Atlantic City Casinos and Resorts. My role included assisting the
        Director with Nightlife Entertainment Procedures and Protocol,
        overseeing services for Entertainment Guests, presenting data, and
        conducting rehearsals. In all of my roles I must be flexible, juggle
        multiple concerns at once, and effectively communicate with my team.
        Attention to detail is always a top priority. I must be able to quickly
        assess any situation and rely on critical thinking to utilize the proper
        strategies and skills for problem solving â€“ professionally and
        accurately.<br></br> I am certain that my unique professional experience and skills translate well into
        the Tech Industry, and will be an asset to any position, team, and
        company.
